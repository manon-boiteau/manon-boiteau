👀 **Looking for new opportinties**  
✨ **Full-Stack JavaScript developer 🔜 july 2021**

😷 2020: what a year, isn't it?!

Finding your professional path is not an easy thing.
I worked in hospitilaty management and lately as Event Project Manager, two sectors that are currently at a standstill.
At the age of 28, I have chosen to reorient myself towards a profession with a future (fingers crossed): Web Developer 🚀 Thanks to [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/) and [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/), I started to learn by myself languages such as HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

As I enjoyed it a lot and wanted to learn more, I decided to step further by joining a Bootcamp at [Le Reacteur](https://www.lereacteur.io/), to become Full-Stack Web & Mobile Developer.
