## 👩🏻‍💻 About me

👀 **Looking for new opportunities to get started in March**  
🥾 **UX-UI Front-End Engineer at WeWard - React Native**  


Hello, I am Manon 👋🏻

😷 2021: what a year, right?! 

Finding your professional path is not an easy thing. 
I worked in hospitality management and lately as an Event Project Manager, two sectors that are currently at a standstill. 

At the age of 28, I chose to reorient myself towards a profession with a future (fingers crossed): Web & Mobile Developer 🚀 

Thanks to [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com/fr/) and [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/), I started to learn by myself languages such as HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. 

As I enjoyed it a lot and wanted to learn more, I decided to step further by joining a Bootcamp at [Le Reacteur](https://www.lereacteur.io/), to become a Full-Stack Web & Mobile Developer.
